Also the frustation of the interaction gameish art is the idea that clicking the "send" button becames
a pain in the butt, it takes a while for you to be able to click send because the dialog changes position
pretty quick and you get a little action with the fade in and the fade out jquery effects. It matches the idea of the Sisyphean task. I wanted to combine it and make it mixed media, with the youtube video playing in the background thanks to tubular, and the typewriter sound entwining with the music from youtube & a dialog that has the texture of an old letter but at the same time looks like a computer dialog. The use of gifs and imagery was fun too. I use Jquery Ui for the dialog and the pen to make it draggable. Using tubular was very annoying, because it is not as flexible so I had to make some changements like making a seperate html,css and javascript document only for the first page, start page.
As for the video, Tubular is kind of annoying too since loading a video might take a while or sometimes you have to refresh the page which is frustating. This assigment made me learn so much especially adding css in jquery which I havent done before.
