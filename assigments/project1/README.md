Also the frustation of the interaction gameish art is the idea that clicking the "send" button becames
a pain in the butt, it takes a while for you to be able to click send because the dialog changes position
pretty quick and you get a little action with the fade in and the fade out jquery effects. It matches the idea of the Sisyphean task. I wanted to combine it and make it mixed media, with the youtube video playing in the background thanks to tubular, and the typewriter sound entwining with the music from youtube & a dialog that has the texture of an old letter but at the same time looks like a computer dialog. I use Jquery Ui for the dialog and the pen to make it draggable. I altered the look of the dialog using css, as well the font Courier and cursive for the instructions to match the aesthetics of the impressionism period (when Van Gogh was alive) Using tubular was very annoying, because it is not as flexible so I had to make some changements like making a seperate html and javascript document only for the first page, start page.
As for the video, Tubular is kind of annoying too since loading a video might take a while or sometimes you have to refresh the page which is frustating. This assignment made me learn so much especially adding css in jquery (javascript file) which I havent done before.
 Even though tubular is annoying, its very fascinating to see the amount of libraries, plugins and APIs there is and to be able to create something with the help of something
