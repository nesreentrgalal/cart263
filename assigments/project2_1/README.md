I was inspired to do this idea when I read this in the article
when the author talked about "pressing contemporary issues such as racial and gender bias in big data and machine intelligence-driven systems"
The T-shirts he mentioned that were sold on Amazon using an unchecked list of verbs and pronouns with an online image generator,
like “Keep Calm and Rape A Lot” tshirts and “Keep Calm and Hit Her”. This shows how an automated machine driven systems are not really neutral, they are rooted in our culture. I was curious so I decided to use a gibberish random text online generator https://randomtextgenerator.com/, and he was right. The text in my dialog box is from
Most of words targeted towards women is marriage, and "his joy of sex ", "mistress", "fail lady", "Ladies bed wisdom theirs men months set.""
"Age attended betrayed her man", they all show sexism towards women and negative connotation. It shows the negrative gender bias that the
author was explaining.
TBH, This project was really tough, I was trying to get out of my comfort zone which was kinda overwhelming since there is different css like win95 css , javascripts and bootstrap css like the login form I modified but was thanks to codeseek which is a library and a website for developers. I love the concept because the article talks about the web, and how do we use the web mostly? through the computer.
I decided to go with Windows 95 aesthetics, since that's how I remember surfing the web as a young kid and since the article does mention kids using the internet in our modern generation. So I wanted to add a mix of modern and vintage.  At the same time I didn't want it to be compelety the same which is why the dialog doesnt look like the typical windows 95 dialog.But nevertheless, I proud that I was able to make it work.  

How it works??
You have to move the mouse around till the dialog pops up, to read the next one you can either move your mouse again or click on close which will activate the windows error sound, and click on the unbias button to see the irony.
There is also the time on the footer navbar and you can hover over the settings in the start menu, I tried as best as I can
to modify this code to my own. Thanks to Alex B (alex-b.me) and CodeSeeker. I wanted the responsiveVoice to use hashtags to symbolize the hastag the social media uses online. The responsiveVoice is contradicting symbolize the idea that we always forget that the internet is not neutral and that it is not a safe place sometimes. I had to admit I have focused a lotttt on aesthetics.
TBH EDITING THE DIALOG WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS. iT TOOK THE LONGEST TIME :(
