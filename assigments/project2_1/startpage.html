          Drag pen to see van gogh's letters to his brother Theo and his iconic
          paintings!
        </p>
        <p>A little about Van Gogh and his relationship with his brother</p>

        <p>
          "I don’t really have any friends except for you, and when I’m ill
          you’re always in my thoughts."
        </p>
        <p>To Theo from The Hague, 22 July 1883</p>

        <p>
          "Theo helped Vincent pursue his life as an artist through his
          unwavering emotional support and love. The majority of Theo's letters
          and communications with Vincent are filled with praise and
          encouragement. Vincent would send Theo sketches and ideas for
          paintings, along with accounts of his day to day experiences, to the
          delight and eager attention of Theo. The two brothers maintained an
          intensive correspondence, with Theo often encouraging his depressed
          brother. Theo was one of the few people who Vincent could talk to and
          confide in. These letters are one of the main and only sources of
          information about Vincent's life, providing many detailed accounts of
          not only the occurrences but also the thoughts and feelings in
          Vincent's life. Over three-quarters of the more than 800 letters
          Vincent wrote during his life were to Theo, including his first and
          his last letters. It is largely thanks to Theo and his wife, Johanna,
          who, in 1914, decided to publish the letters between Theo and Vincent,
          that these letters are available to us today"
