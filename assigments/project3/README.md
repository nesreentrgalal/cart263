PHILOSOPHICAL SIMULATION

This Project is inspired by philosophical ideologies like extensionalism (according to wiki its a philosophical theory or
approach which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will), transhumanism which is the possibility of humans subconcious to be in transplanted in the computer and retro futurism, as well as Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, the idea of copies, like replicants in Blade Runner.

Blade Runner's Voight-Kampff Test and Hal from 2001 Space Odyssey were inspirations for this project. Cyperpunk vibes adds to the retro futurism aesthetics that I was going for.

 Instead of the human asking questions, its the AI asking questions. It also deals with maybe discrimnation between AI and humans, why are humans considered to be the superior race? is it cause we create these AI's? what if an AI surpasses the intellectuality of a human or already did?

I used two libraries Responsive Voice and Jquery. Data.json and responsive voice together to create an AI that has a voice, who communicates to the human viewer, and human viewer answers him by writing in the submission form. I wanted my responsive voice's to have a similar voice to HAL from space odyssey but British, while data.json has the questions that is the AI is asking the robots. I used css to create an atmosphere with the help of codepen and codeseek to create a retro futurism vibe, adding blade runner's soundtrack as well as adding a glitchy gif.

This project went through so much change, at first I was planning to add annyang and eliza to make it more complex and more
interactive, but due to this situation we are in and a lack of time, I had to adapt. I also wanted to try to add particles.js or use ogl Flowmap Deformation but thought it would be too much, so I added the glitchy gif instead and contrasts well with the start page, and  the typewriter effect, (felt bad asking you again for it) I am still very proud that I was able to give
in a final project and I love the aesthetics and retro futurism which reminds me a lot of blade runner.

I also combined two things that I love, philosophy was my second major choice, but what I love about art and coding is that
you can mix art and philosophy together, for example my style is surrealistic, and surrealism was inspired by Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious and subconcious and using dreams. So I am proud of this project that I combined my inspirations from my favourite films, philosophy and interactive art.
